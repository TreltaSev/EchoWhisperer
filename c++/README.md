# EchoWhisperer (C++) v0.0.2

---

### A up-to-date process logger for easy use and bragging rights.

Not that many features as of yet since I just realized I should work on a ui.

* **Command Like Interface**: run most of the executables with "--debug" or "--help" for more information

#
## Whats to Come
---
Im currently working on a election ui for this application and ill make it cross compatiable.
for now though this is all you get: 

```powershell
#!bin/bash
./logger.exe
|=== Bin Folder now Populated
  |=== Loop now started
```
